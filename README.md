🚀 **Brute Force Simulator (C++)**

This C++ project simulates a brute-force attack on a password-protected system. It's designed to demonstrate the concept of brute-force password cracking by systematically testing all possible combinations until the correct password is found. Ideal for educational purposes and understanding cybersecurity fundamentals.

🔑 **Key Features:**

1. **Password Cracking Simulation:**  
   Simulates the process of brute-force attacks by trying all combinations of characters to match the target password.

2. **Customizable Parameters:**  
   Set the target password, character set (letters, numbers, symbols), and maximum length for simulation flexibility.

3. **Performance Metrics:**  
   Displays the time taken to crack the password, number of attempts, and other statistics.

4. **Efficient Algorithms:**  
   Optimized looping and string manipulation for faster simulation execution.

 🧪 **Example Workflow:**

1. **Set target password:**  
   Enter the password to simulate brute-force cracking.

2. **Choose character set:**  
   Select whether to include lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and symbols.

3. **Start the simulation:**  
   The program will try every possible combination and display the progress.

4. **View results:**  
   See how many attempts it took and the time required to crack the password.
